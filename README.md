Code Snippet Manager

Description:
We build a tool for managing and organizing code snippets using Map data structures to categorize and search for snippets based on tags or keywords and their functionality or overall purpose.

Our  overall program/project consists of a total of three files that are the âž–

Header file - CodeSnippetManager.h - Has all the feature functions declared along with its arguments in the ADT class CodeSnippetManager , also the ADT that is primarily used in our program unordered map (due to its lower average time complexity compared to map) is defined.

Backend file- CodeSnippetManager.cpp - As per the header file each snippet function is defined using a unordered map

Frontend/main file- main.cpp - Here we organize each of our features and based on user input the functions declared and defined in the backend are called upon and provide + cater the user needs for the program through the different features.
